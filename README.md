# Server-Side-APIs-Weather

In this project, I had the opportunity to explore the integration of third-party APIs into my applications. By leveraging these APIs, I was able to access their data and functionality by sending specific parameter-based requests to a designated URL. The focus of this project was on building a weather dashboard using HTML and JavaScript.

The weather dashboard aimed to provide users with current weather information as well as a 5-day forecast. To achieve this, I utilized a weather API to fetch the necessary data. By constructing and sending requests to the API's URL with appropriate parameters, I could retrieve real-time weather data.

To present the fetched data to users, HTML was used to structure and design the weather dashboard interface. JavaScript played a crucial role in handling the dynamic aspects of the application. It facilitated the API requests, processed the received data, and updated the user interface accordingly.

Overall, the combination of HTML and JavaScript enabled me to create an interactive and user-friendly weather dashboard. It effectively fetched and displayed accurate weather information, ensuring that users had access to up-to-date forecasts. This project provided me with valuable experience in working with third-party APIs and utilizing them to enhance the functionality of my applications.

## Installation

To install and utilize the application, you can follow these steps using Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

Launch VS Code on your computer.

In the VS Code explorer, locate the index.html file of your application.

Hover over the index.html file, and right-click on it.

From the context menu, choose "Open with Live Server." This action will open your application in your default web browser.

Once the application loads in the browser, you will see a search input field.

Enter the name of the desired city in the search input field to fetch weather information for that location.

After entering the city name, click the "Search" button to initiate the search for weather data.

The application will then make the necessary API requests and display the retrieved information, including the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast, for the searched city.

By following these steps, you can easily install and use the application within VS Code using the Live Server extension.
